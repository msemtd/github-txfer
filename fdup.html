The underlying story, as front man Damian “Pink Eyes” Abraham and guitarist Mike “10,000 Marbles” Haliechuk told Vulture, consists of three primary characters: David, the beaten-down narrator; Veronica, his inspiring new love; and Octavius, a dastardly villain intent on shattering David’s hope. Along the way there are fistfights, explosions, depression, meta plot twists, and enough heartache to fill a midsize cargo ship. Herewith: Haliechuck and Abraham’s full guide to David’s story line. Print it out, laminate it, keep it in your pocket.<br/><br/>1. “Let Her Rest” (instrumental)<br/>Abraham: The music was completely done by the time we got around to doing the narrative. It was structured in a way that certain songs would have natural positions, like a climactic scene or an epiphany scene. And then we sat down, with a book on Shakespearean structure and a Wikipedia entry on play structure, at the Dufferin Mall, a not-so-great mall near all our houses. It’s neutral territory: All our great summits when we’re not agreeing are held there to avoid bloodshed. Almost immediately we decided it should take place in the U.K. and that it should take place in a time that wasn’t our own, and that we wanted a love component to it and a social component to it. The late seventies, early eighties was perfect: all our obsession with anglophile music, and the history of DIY and punk culture, and the death of labor that was happening at the time, could be played with.</div></div><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/hide.png" class="hideshow" alt="hide" onClick="toggle(&quot;N66641&quot;)" id="imgN66641"/><a id="FMID_1127496226FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;">2. “Queen of Hearts”<br/>Haliechuk: It introduces where David’s life is at: He’s one of these downtrodden, factory-working-type guys; he has no hope that things are going to change, that things are going to get better to him. And as it always does, magically, some beautiful woman falls in his lap and he falls in love with her immediately.<br/>Abraham: It’s about these moments of elation we get when we enter a relationship, when all of a sudden we’re snapped out of the darkest periods. You’re working your day job, and the next day work just seems bearable. Like, Wow, I can do this. Specifically, it’s about meeting someone who awakens a different something out of you, that first relationship that you have with someone cooler than you.</div><div class="content" id="N66641"><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/leaf.png" class="hideshow" alt="leaf"/><a id="FMID_1728981472FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;"><a href="https://genius.com/Fucked-up-queen-of-hearts-lyrics">https://genius.com/Fucked-up-queen-of-hearts-lyrics</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Fucked-up-queen-of-hearts-lyrics"><img src="fdup.html_files/ilink.png" alt="User Link" style="border-width:0"/></a></div></div><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/leaf.png" class="hideshow" alt="leaf"/><a id="FMID_1062574759FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;">Sun rises above the factory<br/>But the rays don’t make it to the street<br/>Through the gates come the employees<br/>Beat down and draggin' their feet<br/>Lefties handin' pamphlets, workers comin' in<br/>Two people on the pavement never be the same again<br/>She placed it in his hand, well they must have seen the sparks<br/>Neither understands what just happened to their hearts<br/><br/>Another mornin' of this place has ripped me out of my dreams<br/>Realizin' life’s a waste as the whistle blows off steam<br/>One thing I'm betting on, nothin's ever gonna change<br/>It’s like our progress has just stalled and everyday's the same<br/>She placed it in my hand<br/>Co-workers seen the sparks<br/>I couldn't understand what just happened to my heart<br/><br/>Hello, my name is David, your name is Veronica<br/>Let’s be together let’s fall in love<br/>Hello, my name is David, your name is Veronica<br/>Let’s be together, 'til the stars go out<br/><br/>Well all we need is for somethin' to give, the dam bursts open, we suddenly live<br/>The boot off my throat, life is returning<br/>The boot off my throat, let’s all emote<br/><br/>Dawn breaks across this town and a new dawn breaks for me<br/>Take the pains of the underclass<br/>Tryin' to smile through gritted teeth<br/>We must now all join up and throw off the shackles of shame<br/>United we can’t be defeated<br/>They shall hear us proclaim<br/>I placed it in his hand<br/>Comrades seen the sparks<br/>Couldn't understand what happened to my heart<br/><br/>Hello, your name is David, I am Veronica<br/>Let’s be together, until the water swallows us<br/>Hello, you must be David, I am Veronica<br/>Let’s be together<br/>Until we’re all finally crushed<br/><br/>(Chorus x2)</div></div></div></div><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/hide.png" class="hideshow" alt="hide" onClick="toggle(&quot;N66751&quot;)" id="imgN66751"/><a id="FMID_734935048FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;">3. “Under My Nose”<br/>Abraham: Specifically, this is about when I met my wife. It’s how about every moment we’ve lived, all the failed relationships: It’s all been worth it. We’d actually met years and years before [we dated]: Me and my friends used to be quite mean, and we used to make fun of her friends and her band and things like that. I realize now in retrospect it was a very adolescent way to show my affection. Years later she started coming into the video store that I worked at, and we started dating shortly after that. It just felt so perfectly juvenile and romantic and everything.<br/>Haliechuck: David, though, is a character who is very negative. He’s experiencing all this good stuff with Veronica, but he’s always worried that something bad is on the horizon. The happiness is tinged with worry.</div><div class="content" id="N66751"><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/leaf.png" class="hideshow" alt="leaf"/><a id="FMID_269543710FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;"><a href="https://genius.com/Fucked-up-under-my-nose-lyrics">https://genius.com/Fucked-up-under-my-nose-lyrics</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Fucked-up-under-my-nose-lyrics"><img src="fdup.html_files/ilink.png" alt="User Link" style="border-width:0"/></a></div></div><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/leaf.png" class="hideshow" alt="leaf"/><a id="FMID_1623379882FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;">A wind has changed and now it's wrought<br/>All the sweetest smells he had forgot<br/>Not the faintest stench of the old days<br/>It's all just gonna drift away<br/>Damn those skeptics, harbingers of doom<br/>Negative epidemic, followers of Hume<br/><br/>He understands all her needs<br/>And for that she loves eternally<br/>(?) so natural<br/>We're experiencing something actual<br/>My sun is shinin', how about yours?<br/>It's kind of blindin', burn my eyes pure<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>Now he looks forward to wakin' up<br/>She's unstuck him from his rut<br/>Couldn't wait to go to sleep<br/>And let all problems make their retreat<br/><br/>Used to wake up screamin', stolen from our dreams<br/>Now I wake up beamin', the world it just gleams<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>With a sense of impending doom<br/>That it's all gonna end too soon<br/>I'm too good to be true<br/>Where the fuck is the other shoe?<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/><br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it<br/>It's all been worth it</div></div></div></div><div class="node"><img src="fdup.html_files/hide.png" class="hideshow" alt="hide" onClick="toggle(&quot;N66861&quot;)" id="imgN66861"/><a id="FMID_1490919202FM"/><div class="nodecontent" style="color:#000000;font-size:83%;">4. “The Other Shoe”<br/>Haliechuck: And then the next song, things start to go wrong for him. It’s set to ruin; he can’t get over the dread that some bad thing is going to happen. Things are getting dark for him. The refrain is “we’re dying on the inside.”<br/>Abraham: You wait for it all to fall apart in front of you, and it has to. You just have to brace for that; you can’t let it control your life — which is what, unfortunately, David does in the records. And all these songs can also be about falling in love with a subculture, or a politician. You have these periods that are so amazing, and then you see the flaws.
