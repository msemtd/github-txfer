<node TEXT="Last week, Fucked Up &#x2014; the anthemic Toronto punk band behind 2008 Polaris Prize winner The Chemistry of Common Life &#x2014; released their latest, a critically acclaimed concept album called David Comes to Life. The underlying story, as front man Damian &#x201c;Pink Eyes&#x201d; Abraham and guitarist Mike &#x201c;10,000 Marbles&#x201d; Haliechuk told Vulture, consists of three primary characters: David, the beaten-down narrator; Veronica, his inspiring new love; and Octavius, a dastardly villain intent on shattering David&#x2019;s hope. Along the way there are fistfights, explosions, depression, meta plot twists, and enough heartache to fill a midsize cargo ship. Herewith: Haliechuck and Abraham&#x2019;s full guide to David&#x2019;s story line. Print it out, laminate it, keep it in your pocket.&#xa;&#xa;1. &#x201c;Let Her Rest&#x201d; (instrumental)&#xa;Abraham: The music was completely done by the time we got around to doing the narrative. It was structured in a way that certain songs would have natural positions, like a climactic scene or an epiphany scene. And then we sat down, with a book on Shakespearean structure and a Wikipedia entry on play structure, at the Dufferin Mall, a not-so-great mall near all our houses. It&#x2019;s neutral territory: All our great summits when we&#x2019;re not agreeing are held there to avoid bloodshed. Almost immediately we decided it should take place in the U.K. and that it should take place in a time that wasn&#x2019;t our own, and that we wanted a love component to it and a social component to it. The late seventies, early eighties was perfect: all our obsession with anglophile music, and the history of DIY and punk culture, and the death of labor that was happening at the time, could be played with."

<node TEXT="2. &#x201c;Queen of Hearts&#x201d;&#xa;Haliechuk: It introduces where David&#x2019;s life is at: He&#x2019;s one of these downtrodden, factory-working-type guys; he has no hope that things are going to change, that things are going to get better to him. And as it always does, magically, some beautiful woman falls in his lap and he falls in love with her immediately.&#xa;Abraham: It&#x2019;s about these moments of elation we get when we enter a relationship, when all of a sudden we&#x2019;re snapped out of the darkest periods. You&#x2019;re working your day job, and the next day work just seems bearable. Like, Wow, I can do this. Specifically, it&#x2019;s about meeting someone who awakens a different something out of you, that first relationship that you have with someone cooler than you."

<node TEXT="3. &#x201c;Under My Nose&#x201d;&#xa;Abraham: Specifically, this is about when I met my wife. It&#x2019;s how about every moment we&#x2019;ve lived, all the failed relationships: It&#x2019;s all been worth it. We&#x2019;d actually met years and years before [we dated]: Me and my friends used to be quite mean, and we used to make fun of her friends and her band and things like that. I realize now in retrospect it was a very adolescent way to show my affection. Years later she started coming into the video store that I worked at, and we started dating shortly after that. It just felt so perfectly juvenile and romantic and everything.&#xa;Haliechuck: David, though, is a character who is very negative. He&#x2019;s experiencing all this good stuff with Veronica, but he&#x2019;s always worried that something bad is on the horizon. The happiness is tinged with worry."

You just have to brace for that; you can&#x2019;t let it control your life &#x2014; which is what, unfortunately, David does in the records. And all these songs can also be about falling in love with a subculture, or a politician. You have these periods that are so amazing, and then you see the flaws.
